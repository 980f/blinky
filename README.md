This is a toy for comparing 980f's cortexm library to STM32's HAL and Arduino.

To run this you will have to clone cortexm and ezcpp, see the README in 980f/cortexm repo.

Ezcpp is ancient stuff that I am bit by bit destroying as c++ incorporates equivalent functionality into the language. I am usually at least two major revisions behind the standard as the microcontroller compilers were for a long time lagging quite a bit, espeically if you wanted a bug free version!
